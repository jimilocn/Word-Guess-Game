## About

This game looks at the many different cities with Chicago. The neighborhoods' names will be the word that the user will have to guess to gain a win. The alerts will inform the user when there is a incorrect key strike, if there is a letter than has been used multiple times, and if the player wins or losses!

Each time the user wins or losses, the display will change at the bottom of the screen to reflect that

### Known Issues

* the app does not look the best as a mobile responsive site. there needs to be a bit of editing so that it will work well on a smartphone. There is also a glitch in the game that shows the alert before the letter has been pushed into the "fill in the blank" slots.  This might be an issue with the alerts. In the future, I would like to use a different form of error message than alerts
